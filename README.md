# WDD 330 Portfolio
- Pick-Me-Up website: https://ghostrider86.github.io/WDD-Portfolio/pickMeUp/build/
This is my Final project, the pick me up website uses a few API's to get scriptures, quotes, and memes for the user to enjoy. As well as a invitation page to learn more about the church, where the user can leave feedback if desired.
